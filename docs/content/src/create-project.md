Let's create a project using the Ballerina Integrator dashboard. To do this, click **Create** under the `JSON to XML Transformation and upload to FTP` template. 

A new window will appear at the top of your screen where you can specify the name of your module.

Once you specify the name of the module, you need to choose if your project is a new project or an existing project. In this case you would choose **New Project**.
